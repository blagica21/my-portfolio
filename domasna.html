    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently a student at FINKI where I am studying PIT. I’ve had an interest in technology and design from an early age and I began learning web development on my own even before starting any formal education.
        Previously, I taught myself the basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript through online resources, tutorials and small personal projects. This early experience helped me build a solid foundation and develop a strong curiosity for how websites work.
        Now I am expanding my knowledge through structured learning and more advanced projects. I practiced responsive design user interface structure, and basic interactivity. I also continue to experiment with new technologies and stay updated on modern web development trends.
        In addition to coding I am passionate about programming and I enjoy using creativity to solve problems and bring ideas to life. I’m committed to growing as a developer and look forward to contributing to meaningful digital projects in the future.
